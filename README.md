Group Project 2k21.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Our project will mainly be based on the Python language. We will be making use of PyCharm, PyGame and
NumPy to create our Main Project.
Our Project will be a menu-driven based program which will display three opƟons/buƩons to the user upon
the execuƟon of the main program/opening of the exe compiled file of our program. The three different
buƩons/opƟons will lead the user to the three different sub-projects that we are undertaking. The subprojects are briefly described below:
(i) Self Havoc-> “Self Havoc” will be a 3D-based first person game which will be built by making use of the
Python language and PyGame.
The game will include a main playable character (first person) and a unique 3D map. We might add a few
more funcƟonaliƟes in the game (might be converted into a shooter game) depending upon the amount of
Ɵme we have. The game can be subject to opƟmizaƟons as well. All these factors will be accounted for in the
progress report and the project presentaƟon.
(ii) Image ManipulaƟon-> In this part of our project, we will make use of PyCharm, PyGame and NumPy to
implement all the required funcƟonaliƟes in order to get the desired output. This part of our program should
be able to manipulate an image and display it in terms of ASCII digits/Binary digits (0/1)/Special Symbols
instead of actual pixels. The image will be displayed on the console screen. The image will be loaded from the
code directly and then be subject to further opƟmizaƟon. We might add a few more funcƟonaliƟes in this sub-
project depending upon the amount of Ɵme we have. It can be subject to opƟmizaƟons as well. All these
factors will be accounted for in the progress report and the project presentaƟon.
(iii) Video ManipulaƟon-> (SUBJECT TO CHANGE) In this part of our project, we will make use of PyCharm,
PyGame and NumPy to implement all the required funcƟonaliƟes in order to get the desired output. This part
of our program should be able to manipulate a video and then display it in terms of ASCII digits/Binary digits
(0/1)/Special Symbols instead of actual pixels. The output should be displayed on the main console screen.
We might add a few more funcƟonaliƟes in this sub-project depending upon the amount of Ɵme we have. It
can be subject to opƟmizaƟons as well. All these factors will be accounted for in the progress report and the
project presentaƟon.
NOTE: This parƟcular sub-project might be subject to change (as menƟoned) and might be converted into a
Story-Driven Text-Based RPG game. If that turns out to be the case then the concerned faculƟes will be duly
informed.
